# SentimentAnalysis_WebService

Abstract:

In  this  classifier model,  we  have  Support  vector  machines(SVM) classifier and Naïve Bayes classifier.
These models are trained on the pre labelled dataset from Kaggle and our testing  dataset  are  the  tweets  tweeted 
by  President Donald  Trump.  Because  our  main  motivation  of  this project is to find outany pattern or trend in the tweets of 
president  Trump.  Our  models  have  a  very  good accuracy where Support vector machines can correctly classify 87.3% of the tweets 
accurately and the Naïve Bayes classifier can classify approximately 86% of the tweets  correctly. As  our  classifier  had  a 
very  good accuracy   we   want   to   extend   and   make   it   more generalized. 
So,  we  created a  web  service  with basic authentication which takes a tweetas post request and gives out the sentiment for it as an output.
This paper reports on the design of a sentiment analysismodel, extracting  vast  number  of  tweets  and  developing  a flask  web  service  from  scratch. 
The  models  classify user's perception via tweets into positive and negative. Secondly,  we  discuss  the  step  by  step  techniques 
to carryout sentiment analysis on twitter data in detail.
